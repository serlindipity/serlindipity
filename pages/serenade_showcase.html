                <p>I dedicate this song cover for my parents. My parents have recently celebrated their 25th Wedding Anniversary           
                    last May. I look up to both of them, and being their daughter is one of my greatest blessings in life. One day                    <!-- Short Description -->
                    I want to have the same relationship that they have. Just like the lyrics says <i> 'You're still the one I want for
                    life'</i>, I want my future partner to love me like how my dad continues to love my mom throughout the years of being together.
                </p>

                <h1>Say You<br>Won't Let Go</h1> <!-- Title -->
                <p>This song has always been my favorite. The bridge's lyrics in particular <i>'I wanna live with you, even when we're ghosts, 
                   'cause you were always there for me when i needed you most'. </i> With these lyrics, I realized that life is uncertain,            <!-- Short Description -->
                   you'll never know when or if you are going to lose your loved ones, especially since the pandemic happened. I realized that,
                   it's really important to be there & spend time with the people you love while they're still here, and not take them for granted.

                <h1>The One That<br>Got Away</h1> <!-- Title -->
                <p>Urban dictionary says that <i>'The One That Got Away'</i> pertains to the person who you originally want to end up with, but due to a cause of fate
                   or by consequences, the relationship failed, and as time goes by you wonder what you and that person could have been, making them the one              <!-- Short Description -->
                   that got away. If I would dedicate this song, I would dedicate it to my loved ones that I've lost. Continuing to live life without them is
                   hard & makes me wonder, maybe in another lifetime or timeline, we'll be reunited ..and there, we'll be able to keep our promises.
